### A word from our chair

{:.text-xs}
It is with great pleasure that I begin my first term as Chair of the Érudit Consortium this year. As a professor and researcher, I regularly consult documents on the Érudit platform, and I am proud to be able to contribute to the development of this singular organisation in Canada.
<br><br>
First, I would like to mention, on behalf of the Board of Directors, the wonderful work performed by Dominique Bérubé from 2012 to 2015, when she carried out this role. Her commitment and strategic vision made Érudit one of the main digital platforms for circulating publications in the social sciences and humanities, and were undoubtedly a critical factor in the consortium’s major accomplishments over the last year. Érudit's recognition as a Major Scientific Initiative by the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the establishment of a partnership with Canadian university libraries are just two examples of the achievements of 2015-2016.
<br><br>
There are still great things ahead for the Érudit Consortium and, through it, for the research community in Quebec and Canada.

### A word from our director

{:.text-xs}
After its latest achievements (our recognition as an MSI, as well as our partnership with university libraries), Érudit carried on its mission of disseminating and promoting scholarship from Canada and Quebec. Although our organization has grown substantially for several years, we also operate in a changing environment, and we must fulfil the constantly growing needs of researchers, librarians and publishers for digital services.
<br><br>
Work on our strategic plan, which our Board of Directors and our entire team began this year, is therefore in line with our determination to position the Consortium at the heart of the ecosystem of scholarly communications and digital culture. This will also allow us to provide a framework for preparing major applications for financing, and to consolidate our guiding principles. 
<br><br>
In addition, the Érudit team has expanded even further. We established a development team to better maintain our services, especially in preparation for several major upcoming technological projects. Furthermore, we are happy to have Frédéric Bouchard join us as Chair of Érudit Consortium. I would like to welcome him on behalf of the entire team. Mr. Bouchard's expertise and commitment to promoting research and innovation will be valuable assets for our organization. I would like to thank Dominique Bérubé, our outgoing Chair, for her tremendous work. Her dedication and remarkable managerial abilities have left a lasting imprint on Érudit.
