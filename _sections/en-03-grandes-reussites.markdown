### Renewing and developing our financing opportunities

1. #### Submission of an application to renew the Major Scientific Initiative grant from CFI
  - In early 2015, our organization received a $1.4 million investment from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation as part of its Major Scientific Initiative (MSI) fund. This grant allowed us to maintain our technological infrastructure and our services to publishers, librarians and researchers for two years, and recognized Érudit as the only national initiative for research in the humanities and social sciences. We began preparing our application to renew this financial support, which will ensure greater financial stability for our consortium in the years to come.

2. #### Submission of an application for a Cyberinfrastructure grant from CFI
  - We were actively involved in preparing the application for a Cyberinfrastructure grant filed in 2016 with the Canadian Foundation for Innovation.
  - Headed by Professor Vincent Larivière, Canada Research Chair in the Transformations of Scholarly Communication at the Université de Montréal and Scientific Director of Érudit, this project brought together a dozen researchers and partners in Canada and abroad to focus on new possibilities offered by digital technology for research in the humanities and social sciences.

### Planning our consortium's growth

{:.intro}
Two major components supported and structured the Érudit Consortium’s development in 2015-2016: a strategic planning project and the establishment of an information technology team.

1. #### Strategic planning
  - In a period of significant growth, Érudit has begun to establish the guiding principles governing its activities over the long term. Two consultants from the research community assisted Érudit’s Board of Directors and employees with this project.
  - In addition, the domain of research dissemination is being transformed by the introduction of new research practices (data visualization, the use of corpora, etc.) and the development of the open access movement. Against this backdrop, Érudit must change both its range of services and its business model.

2. #### Creation of an information technology team
  - In preparation for a number of major technological projects, Érudit decided to establish its own internal information technology team. With the assistance of Université de Montréal's human resources department, we hired new employees in autumn 2015 to develop open-source code and enhance knowledge dissemination.  
  - Under the leadership of Davin Baragiotta, this team consists of two developers (David Cormier and Sophy Ouch) and two systems administrators (Philippe Dagenais and David Montminy). At the same time, we rely on several consultants and businesses for some targeted development projects.
  - The creation of this team required some work on knowledge transfer from the members of CEN-R, which has worked with Érudit for several years to maintain our technological infrastructure.

### Promoting our partnership with CRKN

{:.intro}
Érudit signed a partnership with the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN) in order to establish a permanent nationwide solution to support open-access academic publishing. Through this partnership, 53 Canadian university libraries are lending their support to 107 Canadian scholarly journals.

{:.intro}
By developing concrete solutions to the challenge of transitioning to open access, this partnership has had a major impact on the dissemination of research. In 2015-2016, we were also invited to present this initiative at nearly 20 conferences and events in Canada and internationally. A detailed list is provided in the Communications section.

{:.intro}
In partnership with CRKN, we also organized a seminar that brought together more than 120 editors of scholarly journals and university libraries to discuss new models of knowledge dissemination and open access. This day provided an opportunity to explore the challenges currently facing university libraries and scholarly journals in Canada, and resulted in productive discussions between the various stakeholders in the community.

{:.intro}
Two presentations, in particular, drew our attention:

1. #### *Changes in scholarly publishing in the digital era*
  - Vincent Larivière, associate professor at the École de Bibliothéconomie et des Sciences de l’Information at the Université de Montréal, Canada Research Chair on the Transformations of Scholarly Communication and Scientific Director of Érudit, discussed the changes confronting academic publishing in the digital era. Despite the diversification of places of publication, anglicization, slower obsolescence of scholarly literature, and the concentration of publishing in the hands of a few major commercial publishers, scholarly journals continue to play a crucial central role in the research ecosystem. In this context, the open-access dissemination of research has become a key element in maximizing the impact of academic publishing on research.

2. #### *Study on an open access scholarly publishing cooperative*
  - John Willinsky, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Stanford University and the founder and director of the Public Knowledge Project (PKP), discussed the different business models for open-access dissemination of research publications. Circulation by means of green open access (self-archiving of articles) is not entirely appropriate for the humanities. Delayed open-access relies on the exclusion of some readers. The article processing charge (“author pays”) model does not free us from the monopoly of major commercial publishers. Given these facts, a cooperative business model to support open-access dissemination is the best solution, according to Mr. Willinsky, both in terms of the financial capital required, fairness to the various research stakeholders, transparency of management, and the quality of the academic heritage that we are creating.
